Repo for the Dius shopping code test
This is the repository for the DiUS shopping coding test. Written in Java, it comprises the tests and classes necessary for simulating
simple pricing rules for a checkout. For me, a princing rule is a generic object for which there can be different derived objects, applying
the strategy pattern.
