Repo for the Dius shopping code test
This is the repository for the DiUS shopping coding test. Written in Java, it comprises the tests and classes necessary for simulating
simple pricing rules for a checkout. For me, a princing rule is a generic object for which there can be different derived objects, applying the strategy pattern to some extent.
It is a Java 8, Eclipse and maven-based application. Nothing fancy. Hope you like it, hope it is enough TDD-based and it took me a bit more than two hours, to be perfectly honest, but maybe I wanted to reach a little more than the problem statement.
Thank you.
